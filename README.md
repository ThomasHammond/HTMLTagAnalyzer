# HTML Tag Analyzer

HTML Tag Analyzer is a basic demo app that takes in a URL and generates a table showing the types of HTML tags used and the number of occurrences of each tag type.

## To Install and Run:

First clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/thomhammond/HTMLTagAnalyzer.git
```


From the HTMLTagAnalyzer directory:

If you are using a virtual environment (which I highly recommend), first activate your environment and install
the required libraries and dependencies by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and initialize the app by typing:

```
python3 HTMLTagAnalyzer.py
```

Once the app is running, enter any valid URL in the URL Input text box and click the Analyze button to see your results!
